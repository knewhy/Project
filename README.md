# Project
### Hi there ! I'm Napadol Thongthavorn (New). I'm a Junior Data Scientist but I have no work experience so I decided to make this portfolio to prove my entry-level skill (and it's just really entry-level) ;(
I created this to collect projects and exercises that I did while I study online courses + projects that I find it important to know + some Kaggle challenges!
I also want this to be my study progress too, so when I get better in the future in this path, I'll come back to this and I'll realise where I started. So I'll keep learning and updating this portfolio.

## A lot more to come !
